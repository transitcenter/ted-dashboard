                    Do?</h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed mt-4">The TransitCenter Equity Dashboard tracks how well public transit
                    systems in seven US regions serve their riders, and how changes to transit service affect riders
                    over time. The dashboard measures access to opportunity on transit, transit service intensity and
                    transit affordability for people of color, people living in poverty, essential workers, and other
                    people who rely on transit to meet their daily needs. The dashboard also includes metrics of transit
                    reliability and how travel times to key destinations on transit compare to travel times by car. The
                    dashboard shows these data with a series of charts, interactive maps, and downloadable data sets.
                    Data begin in February 2020 and are included for Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City,
                    Philadelphia, San Francisco-Oakland, and Washington D.C.</p>
